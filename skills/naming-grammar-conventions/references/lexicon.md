# Maintain the product lexicon

The conventions in this skill are defaults; each product's vocabulary is specific to its domain. Keep a lexicon when terms recur across teams or layers, and look terms up before coining synonyms.

This is the load-bearing artifact. Consistency is unreachable through better writing, because every file and screen written independently invents a fresh synonym for the same idea. Consistency is only reachable through lookup.

Keep it high level. Record recurring domain concepts, product-wide conventions, cross-layer forms,
and intentional exceptions. Do not inventory every field label, one-off string, local variable, or
schema column. A large product may have thousands of those; they should derive from the lexicon and
their local model rather than be duplicated into it.

## Where it lives

Keep the lexicon in a repository location documented for contributors and agents, such as `docs/lexicon.md` or beside the schema.

## Rules

- When a recurring concept is missing, confirm the term from product evidence or an appropriate owner, then update the lexicon with the naming change.
- One entry per concept, not per layer. The entry carries every layer's form of the term.
- Add an entry when a concept recurs across teams, features, or boundaries, or when ambiguity has a
  material cost. Ordinary fields that already follow an established concept and slot convention do
  not need their own entry.
- The **avoid list matters alongside the canonical term.** It makes known synonym drift reviewable while allowing contextual uses that carry another meaning.
- Put a word on an avoid list only for the named concept. The same word may be canonical for a
  distinct concept, such as `suspended` for an involuntary hold and `paused` for a voluntary break.
- Shared, product-significant enum display values are lexicon entries. Local implementation enums
  that already derive unambiguously from a canonical concept remain with their owning model.
- Record fixed vendor, generated, regulated, localized, privacy-specific, and published legacy forms
  as mappings rather than treating them as drift or precedent for new first-party names.
- When a term is renamed, update the lexicon with the implementation when feasible. For a staged migration, record current, target, and compatibility forms.
- Requirements documents are not the lexicon. PRD prose describes mechanisms; the lexicon names values.

## Product decisions

Register:            operator
Case (UI):           sentence case everywhere
Case (columns):      snake_case
Case (API):          snake_case
Case (code):         camelCase identifiers, PascalCase types
Enum storage:        snake_case
Dates shown as:      Mar 4, 2026, 2:14 PM EST
Currency:            integer minor units, column suffix _cents
Null renders as:     —
Absence states:      unknown / not applicable / withheld / redacted (product-defined display terms)
Acronym casing:      repository or language convention; external forms mapped at the boundary
Toasts:              archived when the result is visible on screen
Persist verb:        save   (not store, not persist)
Read verbs:          get (in-memory) / fetch (I/O) / find (may be empty)

## Terms

### Invoice
display:     Invoice
plural:      Invoices
column:      invoice_id
api:         invoice
code:        Invoice, invoice
definition:  A request for payment issued to an account.
avoid:       bill, charge, payment request, "something here"

### Retry limit
display:     Retry limit
column:      retry_limit  (integer; bounds and default belong in the contract)
api:         retry_limit
code:        retryLimit
definition:  Maximum attempts before an operation stops.
avoid:       retries setting, attempt mode, "how retries are handled"

### Reason
display:     Reason
column:      reason  (text)
api:         reason
code:        reason
definition:  Why a document was archived.
avoid:       why, note, explanation, cause

## Enums

### Document status
stored       display        meaning
active       Active         Available for normal work.
paused       Paused         Temporarily unavailable. Configuration retained.
archived     Archived       No longer in active use. Retained for history.
avoid:       inactive, disabled, off, deleted, "turned off"
```

## Building the first lexicon for an existing product

1. **Inventory the nouns.** List every table, every top-level API resource, and every page title. That is most of the domain.
2. **Find the collisions.** Grep for the obvious synonym clusters (`user` / `customer` / `client`, `delete` / `remove` / `archive`). Each cluster is one concept wearing several names, or two concepts sharing one. Both need deciding.
3. **Ask practitioners and check the contracts.** Prefer the term people in the domain use consistently while checking user comprehension, accessibility, legal wording, and published compatibility. A legacy schema name does not decide the vocabulary by itself.
4. **Separate overlapping from exclusive states.** Use one enum only when states are mutually
   exclusive. Record separate concepts when they can coexist, including configured versus effective
   values.
5. **Record discouraged alternatives.** Build the avoid list from the synonym drift found in step 2 and state intentional exceptions.
6. **Decide the product-level settings** at the top of the file once, so they are not re-litigated per screen.
7. **Do not mass-rename without a migration plan.** Record current, target, and compatibility forms; then make bounded, compatibility-safe changes. An undocumented partial rename adds another vocabulary state.

## Maintain the lexicon

- Any pull request introducing a recurring or product-significant domain concept updates the lexicon
  in the same change. A one-off implementation field does not.
- Any rename updates the lexicon in the same change as the migration.
- Periodically search code and interface strings for entries on the avoid lists. Classify every hit as drift, an intentional distinct meaning, or a lexicon entry to revise.
